Filer v1.0 Beta 3

Filer is an automatic filer organizer. It can move, rename, copy, and much, much more. You could even make it bark. ;-) For extensive help and tips, click on the Help button from with the program.

About this version

Some more bugs were found in the second beta release and a suggested feature was added. Changes since Beta 2:

1) Fixed a bug which caused all Type tests to fail

2) Removed a crash after removing a rule

3) Added the AutoFiler, a helper program which watches folders and runs the Filer on them whenever a new file appears in one of them.

Please e-mail me if you find any bugs.

Usage

Double-click on the Filer to open the list of organization rules. To make it organize files, just drag and drop one or more files onto its icon, right click on a file and choose it from the Open With menu, or give it a list of file names from the Terminal. If a rule doesn't work right, try running it from the Terminal to see what it's doing as it processes your files.


Features

- Choose from a file's name, size, location, type, or attributes as a source for conditions for organization

- A wide variety of possible actions for files which match

- Use substitution patterns in actions for more flexible renaming and organizing

- Wildly extensible through the use of Terminal commands
